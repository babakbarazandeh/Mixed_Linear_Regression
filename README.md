# Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Mixed Linear Regression Problem
Implementation code for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for solving mixed linear regression problem under Gaussian and Laplacain additive noise regime.
# Abstract 
Mixed linear regression (MLR) model is among the most exemplary statistical tools for modeling non-linear distributions using a mixture of linear models. When the additive noise in MLR model is Gaussian, Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is  a widely-used algorithm  for  maximum likelihood estimation of MLR parameters. However, when noise is non-Gaussian, the steps of EM algorithm may not have closed-form update rules, which makes EM algorithm computationally expensive. In this work, we study the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of MLR model when the additive noise has non-Gaussian distribution.  In particular, we consider the case that noise has Laplacian distribution and we first
show that unlike the the Gaussian case, the resulting sub-problems of EM algorithm in this case does not have closed-form update rule and requirrs sovling linear programmming in each iteration. To overcome this issue, we use the idea of parrarelization and use multiple cors to do the compuation (Shichun ... ). 
# Problem Set-up

MLR is a generalization of a simple linear regression model in which the data points $\{(y_i, \bx_{i}) \in \mathbb{R}^ {d+1}\}_{i = 1}^N $ is generated by a mixture of linear components, i.e.,

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\sigma" title="\sigma" /> is the standard deviation of each distribution that is assumed to be known a priori. This limited choice of the additive noise is based on the fact that these two distributions cover wide range of applications such as medical image denoising [[1]](#1), video retrieval [[2]](#2) and clustering trajectories [[3]](#3).  



Our goal is inferring <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\boldsymbol{\beta}^*" title="\boldsymbol{\beta}^*" /> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\{(y_i,&space;\textbf{x}_{i})\}_{i&space;=&space;1}^N" title="\{(y_i, \textbf{x}_{i})\}_{i = 1}^N" /> via Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is the commonly used in practice [[4]](#4). Given the described model, the MLE <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}" title="\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}" /> can be computed by solving: 

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=&space;\arg\max_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}&space;\;&space;\log&space;\mathcal{P}(y_1,\ldots,&space;y_N|&space;\textbf{X},&space;\boldsymbol{\beta})" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}= \arg\max_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \; \log \mathcal{P}(y_1,\ldots, y_N| \textbf{X}, \boldsymbol{\beta})" />


Next, we will discuss how to solve this problem in both Gaussian and Laplacian cases using EM algorithm. 

# EM for Gaussian Case


\subsection{Expectation-Maximization Algorithm}
EM algorithm is an iterative method that in each iteration finds a tight lower-bound for the objective function of the MLE problem and maximizes that lower-bound at that iteration[[5,6]](#5#6)[[6]](#6). More precisely, the first step (E-step) involves updating the latent data labels  and the second step (M-step) includes updating the parameters. That is, the first step updates the probability of each data point belonging to different labels given the estimated coefficients, and the second step updates the coefficients given the label of all data. Let ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{t} = ({\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{1}^{t},\cdots, {\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{t}_{K})$ be the estimated regressors and ${w}_{k,i}^{t}$ be the probability that $i^{th}$ data belongs to $k^{th}$ component at iteration $t$. Starting from the initial points $ \bbeta^0$ and $ w ^{0}_{k,i}$, two major steps of the EM algorithm is as following,\\

E-step:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\begin{aligned}
{w}_{k,i}^{t+1}= \frac{f_{\epsilon}(y_i- \langle \textbf{x}_{i},  \bbeta_{k}^{t}\rangle)}{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{K}f_{\epsilon}(y_i- \langle \textbf{x}_{i},  \bbeta^{t}_{j}\rangle) }, \; \forall k,i, 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

M-step:
\begin{align}\label{M-step}
\nonumber
{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{t+1} &= \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{k = 1}^{K} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} \log \; f_{\epsilon}(y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle)
\\
&=\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} \log \; f_{\epsilon}(y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle).
\end{align}

The problem in~\eqref{M-step} is separable with respect to $\boldsymbol{\beta}_k$'s. Thus, we can estimate  $ \bbeta_k^{t+1}$'s in parallel by solving
\begin{align}\label{M-step-seperate}
 \bbeta^{t+1}_{k}=\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}_k} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} \log \; f_{\epsilon}(y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle), \forall k.
\end{align}
Let us discuss this optimization problem in two cases of Gaussian and Laplacian noise scenarios:

%In the next sections, we derive the solution for problem~\eqref{M-step-seperate} and show that when the additive noise is Laplacian, it results in a challenging problem.  

\vspace{0.2cm}

\subsubsection{Additive Gaussian noise }
When the additive noise has Gaussian distribution, problem~\eqref{M-step-seperate} is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\begin{aligned}
 \bbeta^{t+1}_k = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\beta}_k}  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1}  (y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle)^2, \quad \forall k.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
% The solution of this problem can be easily derived by,
% \begin{align*}
%     \nabla_{\bbeta_k} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1}  (y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle)^2, \quad \forall k. = 0 \rightarrow
% \end{align*}

It can be easily shown that this problem has the closed-form solution of the form  
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_k^{t+1} = (\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} \textbf{x}_i \textbf{x}_i^{T})^{-1} \sum_{ i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} y_i \textbf{x}_i, \;\;\;\forall k.   
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\subsubsection{Additive Laplacian noise }
For the Laplacian case, the problem in~\eqref{M-step-seperate} is equivalent to 
\begin{align}\label{eq:lap}
{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{t+1}_{k} &= \argmin_{\bbeta_k}  \; \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{w}_{k,i}^t 
\;\;  |y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i \rangle|,\quad \forall k.
\end{align}

Despite convexity of this problem,  this optimization problem is non-smooth. Thus, one needs to use sub-gradient or other iterative methods for solving it. However, these methods suffer from slow rate of convergence and they are sensitive to tuning hyperparameters such as step-size~\cite{nemirovsky1983problem}. 
%estimating $ \bbeta^{t+1}$ requires solving (potentially large-scale) nodifferentia$K$ parallel weighted least absolute deviations problem. Despite convexity of the resulting optimization  problem, non-differentiability of this function makes efficient methods such as gradient descent inefficient in practice. 
Another potential approach for solving~\eqref{eq:lap} is to reformulate it as a linear programming problem 
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\begin{aligned}
\; \bbeta ^{t+1}_{k} =& \argmin_{\bbeta_k, \{h_{i}\}_{i = 1}^N}  \;\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {w}_{k,i}^{t+1} h_{i} \quad 
\\
&\textit{s.t.}\quad  h_{i} \geq  y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k, \textbf{x}_i\rangle, \;\;\forall i= 1,\ldots, n,\\
& \quad \quad \; h_i\geq -(y_i - \langle \boldsymbol{\beta}_k,\textbf{x}_i\rangle), \;\;\forall i=1,\ldots,n. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.2cm}


However, this linear programming has to be solved in each iteration of the EM algorithm, which  makes EM computationally expensive in the presence of Laplacian noise (specially in large-scale problems). 

# Summary of the EM algorithm 
The idea behind the proposed algorithm is that in each iteration, the maximization problem is solved to a good accuracy. This gives us an estimate of the gradient of the minimization problem. This gradient is later used for solving the outer minimization problem.

# Reuslts 
We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for the problem of attacking the LASSO estimator. In other words, our goal is to find a small perturbation of the observation matrix that worsens the performance of the LASSO estimator in the training set.
Following figure shows the performance of the Proposed Algorithm (PA) compared to Subgradient Descent-Ascent(SDA), and Proximal Descent-Ascent algorithm (PDA).  
To have a fair comparison, all of the studied algorithms have been initialized at the same random points.

</p> <br/>

The above figure might not  be  a fair comparison  since each step of the proposed algorithm is computationally more expensive than the two benchmark methods.  To have a better comparison,we evaluate the performance of the algorithms in terms of the required time for convergence. Following table summarizes the average time required for different algorithms for finding a stationary point.
